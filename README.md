## Compare Cloud-Optimized Geotiffs from ASDI "sentinel-s1-rtc-indigo" S3 buckets 

This solution demonstrates how to use the free accesible ASDI data from Amazone and analyze it in Sagemaker Studio Lab..

The Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks to accelerate sustainability research and innovation by minimizing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze large sustainability datasets. ASDI supports innovators and researchers with the data, tools, and technical expertise they need to move sustainability to the next level.

The demo will use S3 hosted sentinel-2 geospacial images and compare them in a jupiter notebook running in Sagemaker Studio Lab.
